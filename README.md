High Quality Mesh Generation Helper Code

This basic code snippet I prepared makes it easy to create high-quality quadrilateral mesh in models with many holes.

The mesh structure of a model is one of the most time-consuming parts of the analysis process.

A bad mesh can cause convergence problems, especially in non-linear analyses, which can lead to longer analysis times. It may also lead to inaccuracies in the evaluation of results.

This helper code aims to speed up and improve mesh creation by saving time in the process.

In addition, thanks to the flexibility of this code, it can be adapted and extended to different model types. It works according to the diameter of the holes in the geometry. As a result, it can be reused in a variety of projects.

This code has the following main features:

1. It is determined how many geometries there are.
2. The number of holes is determined.
3. The hole diameter is determined and the geometry is prepared accordingly.
